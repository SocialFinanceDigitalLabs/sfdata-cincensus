![tests](https://github.com/SocialFinanceDigitalLabs/sfdata-cincensus/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)

This module provides a Python interface to the Children In Need Census with
the ability to go to and from the XML format used by the Census as well as the
tabular formats used by the XML generator and data validator.

Finally, we also provide a simple synthetic data generator for testing.
